Table: Prices

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| start_date    | date    |
| end_date      | date    |
| price         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
 

Table: UnitsSold

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 
 

Write a solution to find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Prices table:
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| product_id | start_date | end_date   | price  |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
| 1          | 2019-02-17 | 2019-02-28 | 5      |
| 1          | 2019-03-01 | 2019-03-22 | 20     |
| 2          | 2019-02-01 | 2019-02-20 | 15     |
| 2          | 2019-02-21 | 2019-03-31 | 30     |
+------------+------------+------------+--------+
UnitsSold table:
+------------+---------------+-------+
| product_id | purchase_date | units |
+------------+---------------+-------+
| 1          | 2019-02-25    | 100   |
| 1          | 2019-03-01    | 15    |
| 2          | 2019-02-10    | 200   |
| 2          | 2019-03-22    | 30    |
+------------+---------------+-------+
Output: 
+------------+---------------+
| product_id | average_price |
+------------+---------------+
| 1          | 6.96          |
| 2          | 16.96         |
+------------+---------------+
Explanation: 
Average selling price = Total Price of Product / Number of products sold.
Average selling price for product 1 = ((100 * 5) + (15 * 20)) / 115 = 6.96
Average selling price for product 2 = ((200 * 15) + (30 * 30)) / 230 = 16.96


# Solution

> Select product id from the 'Prices' table.
> Left join the 'UnitsSold' table on product id and 'UnitsSold' purchase date when it is between 'Prices' start date and end date.
> Group by product id.
> Calculate the average price of each product by dividing the total cost by the number of units sold.
> Round to two decimal places.
> Alias the calculation as 'average_price'.
> Return product id and average_price.

SELECT 
  t1.product_id,
  COALESCE(ROUND(SUM(t1.price * t2.units) / SUM(units), 2), 0) AS average_price
FROM Prices AS t1
LEFT JOIN UnitsSold as t2
ON t1.product_id = t2.product_id
AND t2.purchase_date BETWEEN t1.start_date AND t1.end_date
GROUP BY t1.product_id;
