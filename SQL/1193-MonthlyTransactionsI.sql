+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about incoming transactions.
The state column is an enum of type ["approved", "declined"].
 

Write an SQL query to find for each month and country, the number of transactions and their total amount, the number of approved transactions and their total amount.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Transactions table:
+------+---------+----------+--------+------------+
| id   | country | state    | amount | trans_date |
+------+---------+----------+--------+------------+
| 121  | US      | approved | 1000   | 2018-12-18 |
| 122  | US      | declined | 2000   | 2018-12-19 |
| 123  | US      | approved | 2000   | 2019-01-01 |
| 124  | DE      | approved | 2000   | 2019-01-07 |
+------+---------+----------+--------+------------+
Output: 
+----------+---------+-------------+----------------+--------------------+-----------------------+
| month    | country | trans_count | approved_count | trans_total_amount | approved_total_amount |
+----------+---------+-------------+----------------+--------------------+-----------------------+
| 2018-12  | US      | 2           | 1              | 3000               | 1000                  |
| 2019-01  | US      | 1           | 1              | 2000               | 2000                  |
| 2019-01  | DE      | 1           | 1              | 2000               | 2000                  |

# Solution

> Select country from the 'Transactions' table.
> Group by month from trans_date and country.
> Apply SUBSTR to the trans_date column to return the year-month.
> Count the total number of transactions per month in each country.
> Alias the total transactions count as 'trans_count'.
> Count the number of approved transactions per month in each country.
> Alias the approved transactions count as 'approved_count'.
> Sum the total amount of all transactions per month in each country.
> Alias the sum of all transactions as 'trans_total_amount'.
> Sum the total amount of approved transactions per month in each country.
> Alias the sum of approved transactions as 'approved_total_amount'.
> Return month, country, trans_count, approved_count, trans_total_amount, and approved_total_amount columns.
