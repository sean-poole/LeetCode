Output: 
+-------------+----------------+
| customer_id | count_no_trans |
+-------------+----------------+
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |

Explanation: 
Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.


# Solution

> Select customer ID from 'Visits' table.
> Left Join the 'Transactions' table on visit ID.
> Filter the returned rows for where transaction ID is null in the 'Transactions' table, indicating no purchases were made during a visit.
> Group the filtered result set by customer ID from the 'Visits' table.
> Count the occurrences of customer ID where there are no corresponding transactions. Set alias as 'count_no_trans'.
> Return customer ID and the number of visits they had where no transactions were made.

SELECT 
  t1.customer_id,
  COUNT(t1.customer_id) as count_no_trans
FROM Visits AS t1
LEFT JOIN Transactions as t2
ON t1.visit_id = t2.visit_id
WHERE t2.transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY t1.customer_id;
