Table: Views

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| article_id    | int     |
| author_id     | int     |
| viewer_id     | int     |
| view_date     | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table, the table may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.
 

Write a solution to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.

Return the result table sorted by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
Output:

# Solution

Return only the unique ids of authors who viewed their own articles by comparing the author id and viewer id values.
Rows should be sorted by id from smallest to largest.

> Select unique 'author_id' values from 'Views' table and store as 'id'.
> Filter returned rows for entries where author_id === viewer_id.
> Order the filtered rows by id in ascending order.

SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY author_id ASC;
